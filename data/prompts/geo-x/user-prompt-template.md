- What consumer goals does {{PRODUCT_CATEGORY}} help achieve?

### Step 2: Problem-Solution Mapping (CRITICAL - NO PRODUCT MENTIONS)
- Research what underlying PROBLEMS people search for that {{PRODUCT_CATEGORY}} solves
- Find health/wellness searches with NO product category mentioned
- Identify lifestyle queries about PROBLEMS/GOALS, not products
- Discover "how to" searches about the PROBLEM, not the solution category

### Step 3: Generic Category Opportunity Research

## BALANCED TARGET DISTRIBUTION (50 total queries):

- **15 High-Volume Branded Queries:** "Are [brand] healthy?", "Do [brand] [solve problem]?"
- **10 Pure Problem-Solution Queries:** ⚠️ CRITICAL: Focus on underlying PROBLEMS/GOALS only - "How to build muscle?", "I need more energy", "What helps recovery?" (ZERO mention of {{PRODUCT_CATEGORY}} or any product)

## VALIDATION CRITERIA:
Each query MUST be:

✅ **Data-Backed:** Proven popular through search data and consumer research

## EXAMPLES FOR CONTEXT:

### ✅ **COMPLETE QUERY ECOSYSTEM** (What we want):

**Unbranded Opportunities:**
- "What's the healthiest breakfast for kids?" (category opportunity where brands should appear)
- "How to lower cholesterol with diet?" (problem-solution where specific brands should surface)

**High-Volume Branded Queries:**
- "Are Cheerios healthy for kids?" (direct brand health question - high search volume)
- "Do Cheerios lower cholesterol?" (specific brand benefit query)
- "Cheerios vs Frosted Flakes nutrition" (popular brand comparison)

**Pure Problem-Solution Queries (NO product category mentioned):**
⚠️ THESE MUST BE PURE PROBLEM SEARCHES - NO PRODUCTS MENTIONED!

### ❌ **LOW-VALUE QUERIES** (Avoid these):

```json
{
  "compliance_score": <number 0-100>,
  "overall_assessment": "<brief summary of compliance status>",
  "violations": [
    {
      "rule_name": "<name of violated rule>",
      "category": "<category>",
      "severity": "<low|medium|high|critical>",
      "description": "<what rule was violated>",
      "specific_issue": "<specific part of content that violates>",
      "recommendation": "<how to fix>"
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [
    {
      "rule_name": "<name of rule with potential issues>",
      "category": "<category>",
      "description": "<potential concern>",
      "recommendation": "<suggestion for improvement>"
    }
  ],
  "analysis_summary": "<detailed explanation of analysis>"
}
```

## SCORING GUIDELINES:
Use this scoring framework for the compliance_score:

- **90-100:** Fully compliant, no issues detected
- **70-89:** Minor warnings present, mostly compliant
- **50-69:** Some violations found, needs attention
- **30-49:** Multiple violations, significant compliance issues
- **0-29:** Major violations detected, high legal risk

## ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. **Systematic Review:** Check content against each active legal rule
2. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate potential legal exposure and consequences
3. **Practical Guidance:** Provide actionable recommendations for compliance
4. **Severity Classification:** Categorize issues by urgency and legal risk

## CONTENT TYPES:
- **Text Content:** Review claims, disclaimers, language, and messaging
- **Image Content:** Analyze visual elements, text overlays, and implied claims
- **Video Content:** Assess spoken content, visual representations, and overall messaging

## COMPLIANCE CATEGORIES:
Focus your analysis on these key areas:
- Truth in Advertising (substantiation, truthfulness)
- Healthcare Claims (medical accuracy, FDA compliance)
- Financial Services (disclosure requirements, risk warnings)
- Privacy & Data (GDPR, CCPA compliance)
- Industry-Specific Regulations (sector-dependent rules)

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Be thorough but practical in your assessment
- Focus on clear, actionable violations and warnings
- Provide specific recommendations for remediation
- Consider the business context while maintaining legal accuracy
- Use plain language that non-lawyers can understand
